# python-list-christmas

This is the repository of the Christmas Python List Video Tutorial of the Cool Kitten Coding Café. 
The cuteness overload cat packed video is available [here](https://youtu.be/uHOyl458l70).

### Requirements
In order to run the christmas list.py file, you will need to have Python set up on your computer. Please go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version matching your system.

You may choose to look at the jupyter notebook [christmasnotebook.ipynb](https://github.com/CoolKittenCodingCafe/python-list-christmas/blob/master/jupyter%20notebook/christmasnotebook.ipynb) directly from this repository, or to download it to be able to run on your computer. You will need to set up [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and then launch Jupyter notebook, then search for this repository you just downloaded, navigate to the folder, and finally run the notebook.

### Newbies
I would advise to start with reading the jupyter notebook [christmasnotebook.ipynb](https://github.com/CoolKittenCodingCafe/python-list-christmas/blob/master/jupyter%20notebook/christmasnotebook.ipynb) online after watching the [video](https://youtu.be/uHOyl458l70) and then practice a few examples in your Python Idle. If you can, please really try setting up Anaconda as it will be useful when I share machine learning project tutorials.
